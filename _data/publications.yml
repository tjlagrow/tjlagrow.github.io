  abstract: >
    Review of resting-state fMRI features across rodents and humans, comparing acquisition,
    preprocessing, and analysis choices that influence functional connectivity. The paper surveys
    time-averaged and time-varying metrics (e.g., sliding windows, quasi-periodic and co-activation
    patterns), links them to structural connectivity, and discusses applications to neurological
    and psychiatric disorders. It closes with open problems to make rodent-to-human translation more
    reliable.

    Using Human Connectome Project data, the authors test whether parcel-wise complexity metrics
    (correlation dimension, approximate entropy, Lyapunov exponent) mainly reflect neural dynamics
    or are driven by basic BOLD properties. They find these complexity measures are reliable across
    scans and strongly tied to each region’s frequency profile, indicating that frequency content
    can confound interpretations of “complexity” in rs-fMRI.

    Presents a modular ecosystem of containerized tools and workflows for petascale neuroimaging,
    enabling reproducible end-to-end processing across modalities like electron microscopy and
    X-ray microtomography. The framework standardizes storage, execution, and optimization and is
    demonstrated on synapse-level connectome estimation and large-scale cell density mapping.

    Introduces an automated pipeline for estimating cellular densities and identifying laminar
    transitions in neuroanatomical images. The method combines patch extraction, cell detection,
    and sparse approximation for count data using total-variation regularization to robustly recover
    layer boundaries and density profiles across cortical and retinal samples.

    Proposes ArCaDe, an automated approach to estimate spatially varying cell densities and detect
    laminar structure in cortical and retinal tissue. By modeling counts with a sparse, TV-regularized
    estimator and coupling it with patch-wise cell detection, the method recovers cytoarchitectonic
    transitions without manual annotation.

    Demonstrates an NLP pipeline that identifies software and methods referenced in arXiv articles
    and uses the extracted names to explore usage patterns across research areas. The study argues
    that automated extraction at scale complements traditional literature surveys for tracking
    technologies and methods in scientific work.
