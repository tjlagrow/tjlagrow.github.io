  abstract: >
    Review of resting-state fMRI features across rodents and humans, comparing acquisition,
    preprocessing, and analysis choices that influence functional connectivity. The paper surveys
    time-averaged and time-varying metrics (e.g., sliding windows, quasi-periodic and co-activation
    patterns), links them to structural connectivity, and discusses applications to neurological
    and psychiatric disorders. It closes with open problems to make rodent-to-human translation more
    reliable.

    Using Human Connectome Project data, the authors test whether parcel-wise complexity metrics
    (correlation dimension, approximate entropy, Lyapunov exponent) mainly reflect neural dynamics
    or are driven by basic BOLD properties. They find these complexity measures are reliable across
    scans and strongly tied to each region’s frequency profile, indicating that frequency content
    can confound interpretations of “complexity” in rs-fMRI.

    Proposes ArCaDe, an automated approach to estimate spatially varying cell densities and detect
    laminar structure in cortical and retinal tissue. By modeling counts with a sparse, TV-regularized
    estimator and coupling it with patch-wise cell detection, the method recovers cytoarchitectonic
