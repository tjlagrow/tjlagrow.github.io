Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t break the brain all at once.

Long before a clinical diagnosis, the brain’s major networks start drifting out of sync: subcortical systems lose their grip, control networks wobble, and the coordinated, repeating patterns that support healthy function begin to thin out.

In our recent work, we asked a simple question with a technically loaded answer:

> **Can we track the progression of Alzheimer’s disease by looking at how the brain’s large-scale spatiotemporal patterns fall apart over time?**

This post walks through the core ideas behind that study—what we measured, how we measured it, and why it matters for catching the disease earlier and tracking it more reliably.

## The big idea: follow the brain’s recurring rhythms

Most clinical fMRI analysis still leans on **static functional connectivity**: average correlations across a 5–10 minute scan. That’s like judging city traffic patterns from a single long-exposure photo: you see structure, but you miss the dynamics, instability, and bottlenecks forming in real time.

We focus instead on **Quasi-Periodic Patterns (QPPs)**:

- Repeating, large-scale waves of activity rolling through the brain over ~20–30 seconds.
- Captured directly from the data without seeds or predefined events.
- Previously shown to:
  - Be robust across individuals and species.
  - Relate to core networks like the default mode and attention systems.
  - Differentiate disease states better than static connectivity in some animal models.

In this project, we treat QPPs as **dynamic fingerprints of network integrity**:
if those patterns weaken, distort, or stop recurring, it’s a sign that the underlying functional networks are breaking down.

## Data: stable vs. transitioning Alzheimer’s trajectories

We use resting-state fMRI data from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)** and split subjects into two broad tracks:

1. **Stable cohorts (Group 1)**  
   - sNC: stable normal controls  
   - sMCI: stable mild cognitive impairment  
   - sDAT: stable dementia of Alzheimer’s type  

2. **Transitioning cohorts (Group 2)**  
   - uNC: individuals who progress from NC → MCI  
   - pMCI: individuals who progress from MCI → DAT  
   - For each, we label scans as:
     - **PRE:** before diagnostic transition  
     - **POST:** after transition

We map all data into a standardized functional space using the **NeuroMark v2.2 atlas**, which organizes the brain into 105 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) grouped into domains (cerebellar, visual, sensorimotor, subcortical, higher cognitive, triple-network, etc.).

This lets us ask: _as people move along the AD spectrum, which networks’ spatiotemporal patterns fail first, and how does that failure spread?_

## Methods in plain language

The workflow is conceptually simple (the implementation is less cute):

1. **Extract QPPs**
   - Use QPPLab to identify recurring QPP templates from resting-state data.
   - Each QPP template is a time-resolved pattern of activity across the 105 ICNs over a fixed window (~24 seconds).

2. **Project across groups**
   - For each disease stage, we:
     - Derive its own QPP templates.
     - Project those templates onto other groups’ data via sliding template correlation.
   - This tests **how often** each template reappears and **how faithfully** it matches, across disease stages.

3. **Quantify network integrity**
   - Compute correlation matrices from QPP templates.
   - Compare:
     - **Self-correlations** (template with itself) as a baseline.
     - **Cross-correlations** between templates from different groups.
   - Translate this into **“network integrity” metrics**:
     - How much structure is preserved within and across networks.
   - Use **Kruskal–Wallis** + **Dunn’s post-hoc tests** to identify statistically reliable differences across stages.

The result: a dynamic connectivity readout that doesn’t just say “these regions are less connected,” but “these recurring, organizing patterns of brain activity are collapsing in specific networks as disease advances.”

## What we found (without the full wall of matrices)

### 1. Stable groups follow a clear breakdown trajectory

Across sNC → sMCI → sDAT, we see a **progressive loss of network integrity** in QPP dynamics:

- **Early hits**:
  - Paralimbic regions  
  - Extended thalamic subcortical circuits  
  - Frontal and insular-temporal higher-order networks  
- These are systems involved in **memory, executive control, emotional regulation, attention**.

- **Later stages (sDAT)**:
  - Disruptions spread into:
    - Cerebellar domains  
    - Visual networks  
    - Temporoparietal association areas  
    - Core triple-network components (default mode, central executive)
  - QPP-based connectivity shows **widespread disconnection**, not just subtle weakening.

Static connectivity alone struggles to tell this story cleanly. QPP-based measures make the progression more structurally explicit.

### 2. Transitioning groups show trouble early

The transitioning cohorts—those who **haven’t yet “officially” converted** at the time of some scans—are the interesting ones.

Key observation:

- Even **before** formal diagnosis:
  - uNC and pMCI groups show **earlier disruptions** in:
    - Visual networks (occipital and occipitotemporal)
    - Cerebellar networks
    - Sensorimotor systems

In other words, **the dynamic patterns start failing in sensory and cerebellar circuits before full-blown cognitive deficits are stamped into the chart.**

This suggests these domains may act as **early-warning sites**:
if their QPP signatures are degrading, a person may be on a path toward symptomatic Alzheimer’s—even if traditional readouts still look “okay.”

---

### 3. QPP occurrences decline with disease severity

When we count how often QPPs show up:

- Healthy and early-stage groups:
  - **Frequent**, well-formed QPP recurrences.
- More advanced and transitioning groups:
  - **Fewer** occurrences
  - Less coherent projections

This drop in QPP occurrence and fidelity lines up with the idea that AD is not just about isolated regional damage, but a **loss of the brain’s ability to maintain large-scale, organized, time-varying coordination.**

That shift—from flexible, rhythmic dynamics to sparse, unstable patterns—is exactly the kind of signal we want if we’re trying to detect disease progression earlier and more robustly.

---

## Why this matters

A few reasons this framework is promising:

1. **Dynamic, not static**  
   QPPs capture transient instabilities that static connectivity averages away.

2. **Network- and pattern-level view**  
   Instead of “this edge is weaker,” we see:
   - How **whole-brain motifs** change.
   - Which networks stop participating in those motifs.
   - How that evolves across longitudinal trajectories.

3. **Compatible with real clinical data**
   - Works on **standard ADNI-style scans** (TR=3s, multi-site, real-world noise).
   - Uses an atlas (NeuroMark) explicitly built for reproducibility at scale.

4. **Path to biomarkers**
   - Declining QPP occurrence + disrupted projections offer:
     - A candidate **functional biomarker** for staging.
     - A way to track **who is drifting toward impairment** before classic metrics fully tip.

This is not a clinical tool yet. But it’s a concrete step toward **time-resolved, network-aware markers** that reflect how Alzheimer’s truly unfolds in the brain.

---

## Limitations (the honest version)

A few constraints worth stating out loud:

- **Temporal resolution** (TR=3s) limits sensitivity to faster dynamics.
- **Transitioning groups** are relatively small compared to stable cohorts.
- QPP detection and projection choices (window size, thresholds) can influence outcomes and should be stress-tested.
- There’s room to:
  - Integrate with **cPCA**, autoencoders, or other sequence models.
  - Use **higher-resolution** datasets.
  - Combine QPP metrics with structural, molecular, or cognitive markers.

So: promising, but deliberately conservative.

---

## Where this is heading

The larger trajectory here is straightforward:

- Treat large-scale spatiotemporal patterns as **first-class signals**, not side effects.
- Use tools like QPPs to:
  - Identify **early functional fractures** in at-risk individuals.
  - Track **how interventions** (pharmacological or behavioral) impact network stability.
  - Build **multimodal biomarkers** that respect the brain as a dynamic system.

Alzheimer’s is not just “less connectivity.” It is a progressive loss of coordinated, rhythmic, large-scale brain behavior.

If we want to catch it early, we have to look where that coordination lives—in the patterns that repeat, and in how they fail.
